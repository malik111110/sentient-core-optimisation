  • As a solo developer, I want to generate a full-stack application from a single prompt so that I can save days of setting up boilerplate code.
  • As a product manager, I want to create a clickable prototype with a real backend so that I can get meaningful user feedback before committing engineering resources.
  • As a senior engineer, I want to use the "Pro Mode" IDE so that I can manually refine and customize the AI-generated code.
### 1.2.4 Use Cases
A step-by-step description of a user's interaction with the system.
Use Case 1: Generating a New Application via "YOLO Mode"
  • Actor: Developer
  • Precondition: The developer is logged into the platform.
  • Flow:
    • Developer navigates to the "Create New Project" page.
    • Developer enters a prompt: "A blog platform with user accounts and markdown posts".
    • Developer clicks the "Generate" button.
    • The system displays a progress indicator while the AI agents work.
    • The Orchestrator dispatches tasks to the architecture, backend, and frontend agents.
    • Agents generate code, configuration files, and database schemas in an E2B sandbox.
    • Upon completion, the system loads the generated files into the WebContainer IDE.
    • The application starts automatically, and a live preview is shown to the developer.
  • Postcondition: A complete, runnable blog application is available in the developer's workspace.

# 2. Design Documents
This section covers visual design, data architecture, and high-level API contracts.
## 2.1 Wireframes and Mockups
Visual assets such as wireframes and mockups will be embedded directly into this section for review. The AI agents will generate these assets and use markdown image tags to display them.
Instructions for Embedding:
Use the following markdown syntax: ![Description of the image](URL_to_the_image_asset)
### Example Layout: User Dashboard

# 3. Technical Documentation
This section contains detailed technical specifications, standards, and justifications.
## 3.1 Architecture Overview
This document describes the high-level architecture of the [Project Name] platform, referencing the formal architecture diagram. The system is designed using a hybrid model that separates the user-facing IDE from the AI execution environment to optimize for performance and security.
Reference: [Link to Architecture Diagram]
### 3.1.1 Core Components
  • Client-Side (StackBlitz WebContainer): An in-browser IDE that provides the complete user-facing development environment. It is responsible for all UI rendering, code editing, and real-time application previews. Its zero-latency nature is critical for a smooth developer experience.
  • Backend Services (Application Server / Agent Orchestrator): The central control plane, likely built in Node.js or Python. It handles user management, project state, and API requests. Its most critical role is to interpret user goals and orchestrate the AI agents, dispatching tasks to the E2B environment.
  • AI Execution Environment (E2B Secure Cloud Runtimes): The powerhouse of the platform. AI agents run in secure, isolated Firecracker microVMs. This environment is language-agnostic, providing agents with the necessary tools (filesystem access, process execution, internet access) to perform complex code generation and analysis tasks safely.
  • Data & State Management: A set of specialized data stores:
    • Primary DB (PostgreSQL): Stores relational data like users, projects, and permissions.
    • Vector DB (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate): Provides long-term memory for AI agents, allowing them to retrieve contextually relevant information and examples.
    • Asset Storage (S3/Blob): Stores project files, documentation, and generated artifacts.
### 3.1.2 Data Flow
  A user request originates from the WebContainer IDE and is sent to the Agent Orchestrator.
  The Orchestrator validates the request, creates a task plan, and invokes the E2B API to provision a secure sandbox.
  The relevant AI agents are loaded into the E2B sandbox, where they execute the task, potentially querying the Vector DB for context.
  Generated artifacts (code, files) are saved to the E2B filesystem.
  The Orchestrator retrieves the results from the E2B sandbox and updates the project state in the Primary DB.
  The final files are pushed back to the user's WebContainer IDE via a WebSocket connection, completing the loop.
## 3.2 Code Documentation Standards
All generated code must adhere to the following documentation standards to ensure maintainability and clarity.
### 3.2.1 In-line Comments
  • Use in-line comments to explain complex, non-obvious, or critical sections of code. Do not comment on obvious code.
  • Good: // A B-tree is used here for faster lookups on indexed fields.
  • Bad: // Increment the counter by one.
### 3.2.2 Function / Class Headers
Use JSDoc (for JavaScript/TypeScript) or Python Docstrings to document all public functions, methods, and classes.
JavaScript/TypeScript Example (JSDoc):
```javascript
/**
 * Fetches a user profile from the API.
 * @param {string} userId - The unique identifier of the user to fetch.
 * @returns {Promise<Object|null>} A promise that resolves to the user object, or null if not found.
 */
async function getUserProfile(userId) {
  // ... implementation
}
```
Python Example (Google Style Docstring):
```python
def get_user_profile(user_id: str) -> dict | None:
    """Fetches a user profile from the database.

    Args:
        user_id: The unique identifier of the user to fetch.

    Returns:
        A dictionary containing the user's profile data, or None if the
        user could not be found.
    """
    # ... implementation
```
### 3.2.3 Module/Component READMEs
  • Every major feature or standalone component directory (e.g., src/components/UserProfile) should contain a README.md file.
  • The README should explain:
    • The purpose of the module/component.
    • How to use it (props, APIs).
    • Any dependencies it has.
## 3.3 API Specifications (Detailed)
This is the detailed technical specification for developers implementing or consuming the API.
### Authentication
  • Method: JWT Bearer Token
  • Flow:
    • Client sends credentials to POST /api/v1/auth/login.
    • Server validates credentials and returns a short-lived JSON Web Token (JWT).
    • Client must include the token in the Authorization header for all subsequent requests: Authorization: Bearer <token>.
  • Token Details:
    • Algorithm: HS256
    • Expiration: 15 minutes
    • Payload Claims: sub (user_id), iat (issued_at), exp (expiration_time).
### Error Codes
The API uses standard HTTP status codes. The response body for errors will contain a machine-readable error object.
Error Response Body:
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "resource_not_found",
    "message": "The requested project with ID 'xyz' does not exist.",
    "statusCode": 404
  }
}
```
Status Code | code | Description
--------------------------------
400 Bad Request | invalid_input | The request body or parameters are malformed or fail validation.
401 Unauthorized | unauthenticated | No valid JWT was provided.
403 Forbidden | permission_denied | The authenticated user does not have permission to perform the action.
404 Not Found | resource_not_found | The requested resource (e.g., project, user) does not exist.
500 Internal Server Error | internal_error | An unexpected error occurred on the server.

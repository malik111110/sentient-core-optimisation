# Platform Scalability and Performance Testing Guide

**Last Validated:** June 2025

## 1. Introduction

For the Archon Agentic Development Engine to be a robust and reliable platform, it must be able to handle a growing number of users, agents, tasks, and data volumes without degradation in performance or stability. This guide outlines strategies and best practices for conducting scalability and performance testing, ensuring the Archon platform can meet current and future demands.

## 2. Goals of Scalability & Performance Testing

*   **Determine System Capacity:** Identify the maximum load the system can handle while meeting performance targets.
*   **Identify Bottlenecks:** Pinpoint components or resources that limit scalability (e.g., CPU, memory, database, network, specific agent logic, LLM API rate limits).
*   **Ensure Stability Under Load:** Verify that the system remains stable and recovers gracefully from peak load conditions.
*   **Measure Response Times:** Quantify system responsiveness for key user interactions and agent tasks under various load levels.
*   **Validate Scalability:** Confirm that the system can scale (e.g., by adding more resources) to meet increased demand.
*   **Establish Baselines:** Create performance benchmarks for future comparisons after updates or changes.
*   **Inform Capacity Planning:** Provide data to make informed decisions about infrastructure requirements.

## 3. Types of Performance Tests

*   **Load Testing:** Simulates expected user traffic and transaction volumes to assess system behavior under normal and peak conditions.
    *   *Archon Context:* Simulate concurrent users interacting with agents, submitting tasks, and agents performing LLM calls and tool executions.
*   **Stress Testing:** Pushes the system beyond its normal operating limits to determine its breaking point and how it recovers.
    *   *Archon Context:* Overwhelm agents with tasks, exceed LLM rate limits, or saturate database connections.
*   **Soak Testing (Endurance Testing):** Runs a sustained load over an extended period to detect issues like memory leaks, resource exhaustion, or performance degradation over time.
    *   *Archon Context:* Simulate continuous agent operation and task processing for several hours or days.
*   **Spike Testing:** Evaluates system performance when subjected to sudden, massive bursts of traffic.
    *   *Archon Context:* Simulate a sudden influx of many users starting complex workflows simultaneously.
*   **Volume Testing:** Tests the system's ability to handle large volumes of data, such as large file uploads/downloads by agents, extensive logging, or large datasets for RAG.
    *   *Archon Context:* Agents processing large codebases, extensive interaction logs, or large context windows for LLMs.
*   **Scalability Testing:** Determines how effectively the system can scale up (vertical scaling: adding more resources to existing servers) or scale out (horizontal scaling: adding more servers).
    *   *Archon Context:* Test how adding more agent worker instances or increasing database capacity affects overall throughput and response times.

## 4. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### 4.1. System-Level KPIs

*   **Response Time:** Average, median, 95th percentile (p95), 99th percentile (p99) response times for API endpoints and key user actions.
*   **Throughput:** Transactions per second (TPS), requests per second (RPS), tasks processed per minute/hour.
*   **Error Rate:** Percentage of requests resulting in errors (e.g., HTTP 5xx errors, agent task failures).
*   **Resource Utilization:** CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O, network bandwidth on servers hosting the Archon backend, database, and any supporting services.
*   **Concurrency:** Number of concurrent users or active agent sessions.

### 4.2. Archon-Specific KPIs

*   **Agent Task Completion Time:** Average time taken for different types of agent tasks to complete.
*   **LLM Interaction Latency:** Latency of calls to LLM APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.), including time-to-first-token and total generation time.
*   **Tool Execution Time:** Time taken for agents to execute specific tools.
*   **Task Queue Length & Wait Time:** Average number of tasks waiting in the orchestrator's queue and average wait time before processing.
*   **Database Query Performance:** Execution time for critical database queries, especially those related to task management, agent state, or logging.
*   **WebSocket/Message Broker Performance (if applicable):** Latency and throughput for real-time communication between agents or with the frontend.

## 5. Performance Testing Process

1.  **Define Objectives & Scope:** Clearly state what aspects of the system will be tested and the goals of the testing.
2.  **Identify Key Scenarios:** Select representative user workflows and agent task patterns that are critical to performance and scalability.
3.  **Establish Baselines:** Run initial tests on a stable environment to establish current performance benchmarks.
4.  **Design Test Cases & Scripts:** Develop automated test scripts that simulate user interactions and agent activities.
5.  **Configure Test Environment:** Set up a dedicated test environment that closely mirrors the production environment in terms of hardware, software, and network configuration. Isolate it from production traffic.
6.  **Prepare Test Data:** Generate or obtain realistic test data in sufficient volumes.
7.  **Execute Tests:** Run the performance tests according to the plan, gradually increasing the load.
8.  **Monitor System Resources:** Continuously monitor KPIs and system resource utilization during test execution.
9.  **Analyze Results:** Collect and analyze test results, identify bottlenecks, and correlate performance metrics with resource usage.
10. **Report Findings & Recommendations:** Document the test results, performance characteristics, identified bottlenecks, and recommendations for improvement.
11. **Tune & Retest:** Make necessary optimizations (code changes, configuration tuning, infrastructure adjustments) and re-run tests to verify improvements.

## 6. Tools for Performance Testing

### 6.1. Load Generation Tools

*   **k6 (by Grafana Labs):** Modern load testing tool for developers and testers. Scripts in JavaScript. Good for API testing.
*   **JMeter (Apache):** Open-source Java-based tool, highly extensible, supports various protocols.
*   **Locust:** Open-source Python-based tool, allows writing tests in Python, good for distributed testing.
*   **Artillery:** Modern load testing toolkit, scripts in YAML or JavaScript, good for testing complex applications and APIs, including WebSockets.
*   **Playwright / Puppeteer / Selenium:** While primarily for E2E functional testing, they can be used in conjunction with load testing frameworks to simulate realistic browser-based user interactions, though they are more resource-intensive per virtual user.

### 6.2. Monitoring & Profiling Tools

*   **Prometheus & Grafana:** For collecting and visualizing time-series metrics from servers, applications, and databases.
*   **Datadog, New Relic, Dynatrace:** Comprehensive APM (Application Performance Monitoring) solutions that provide deep insights into application performance, distributed tracing, and infrastructure monitoring.
*   **Sentry:** For error tracking and performance monitoring, can help identify slow transactions.
*   **Python Profilers (cProfile, Pyflame, Scalene):** For identifying performance bottlenecks within the Python-based Archon backend and agent code.
*   **Database-Specific Monitoring Tools:** (e.g., `pg_stat_statements` for PostgreSQL/Supabase) to identify slow queries.
*   **LLM Observability Platforms (LangSmith, Arize AI, Helicone):** Crucial for monitoring latency and token usage of LLM calls (see LLM Observability Guide).

## 7. Performance Testing Strategies for Archon Components

### 7.1. FastAPI Backend

*   Use tools like k6 or Locust to send concurrent API requests to all critical endpoints.
*   Test authentication/authorization overhead.
*   Monitor database connection pool usage.
*   Profile Python code under load to find hotspots.

### 7.2. Agent Orchestrator & Task Queue

*   Simulate a high volume of task submissions with varying priorities and dependencies.
*   Monitor task queue length, wait times, and processing throughput.
*   Test the orchestrator's ability to efficiently assign tasks to available agents.

### 7.3. Individual Agents

*   Isolate and test the performance of critical agent capabilities, especially those involving complex logic, tool usage, or multiple LLM calls.
*   Measure resource consumption (CPU, memory) per agent instance.

### 7.4. LLM Interactions

*   Simulate concurrent calls to LLM APIs, being mindful of rate limits.
*   Test strategies for handling rate limit errors (e.g., retries with exponential backoff).
*   Measure latency and token costs for different prompt structures and models.
*   If using local LLMs, test their inference speed and resource usage under load.

### 7.5. Database (Supabase/PostgreSQL)

*   Test concurrent read/write operations on key tables (tasks, agent states, logs).
*   Identify and optimize slow queries using `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` and database monitoring tools.
*   Evaluate the performance of database indexing strategies.
*   Test connection pooling and overall database server resource utilization.

### 7.6. WebContainer Usage (if agents use it)

*   If agents utilize WebContainers for tasks like code execution, test the performance of WebContainer instantiation, file mounting, and process execution under concurrent agent requests.
*   Monitor browser resource consumption if WebContainers are heavily used client-side and this impacts overall user experience related to agent interactions.

## 8. Scalability Considerations

*   **Stateless Services:** Design backend services and agents to be as stateless as possible to facilitate horizontal scaling.
*   **Horizontal Scaling:** Test deploying multiple instances of the FastAPI backend and agent workers behind a load balancer.
*   **Database Scalability:** Evaluate Supabase/PostgreSQL read replicas or other scaling options if the database becomes a bottleneck.
*   **Asynchronous Operations:** Leverage asynchronous programming (`async/await` in Python) extensively to handle I/O-bound operations efficiently.
*   **Caching:** Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data that doesn't change often (e.g., agent capabilities, configuration data).

## 9. Conclusion

Platform scalability and performance testing are essential, ongoing activities for the Archon Agentic Development Engine. By systematically testing, analyzing, and optimizing the system, we can ensure it delivers a responsive, stable, and scalable experience for users and their AI agents. Start with simple load tests for key components and gradually increase complexity and coverage as the platform evolves.

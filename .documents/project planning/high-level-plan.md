#### **Detailed Agentic Workflow Implementation**

The project will be executed through specialized AI agents orchestrated by LangGraph:

#### **Phase 1 Workflow: Discovery & Scoping**
*   **Governing Agent:** `ProductManagerAgent`
*   **Objective:** To convert a user's initial, often vague, idea into a concrete and validated set of requirements for the application.
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  The user is presented with an initial choice: free-form text input or a guided branching quiz.
    2.  The `ProductManagerAgent` receives the input and analyzes it against a "completeness" checklist defined in its system prompt.
    3.  **Conditional Edge (LangGraph):** If the information is insufficient, the graph loops into a "Clarification" node. The agent generates up to three specific, open-ended follow-up questions regarding the app's **Purpose, Design Style, and Unique Features.**
    4.  Once sufficient information is gathered, the agent transitions to a "Confirmation" node. It generates two successive rounds of structured, multiple-choice quizzes. These quizzes are defined by Pydantic models to ensure a valid response format.
    5.  The user's selections are captured and validated.
*   **Input:** User's natural language request.
*   **Output:** A validated JSON object (`app_brief.json`) added to the main `State` object. This JSON contains a structured breakdown of the app's purpose, target audience, style, and core features.

#### **Phase 2 Workflow: Visual Architecture & Design**
*   **Governing Agent:** `UI_UX_ArchitectAgent`
*   **Objective:** To translate the textual application brief into visual artifacts, allowing the user to make tangible design choices.
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  The agent ingests the `app_brief.json` from the `State` object.
    2.  It makes two parallel calls to the **Google Gemini 1.5 Pro** model.
    3.  **Call 1 (Wireframes):** The prompt instructs the model to generate two distinct layout versions for the primary screens. The required output format is a structured JSON describing the UI components and their hierarchy.
    4.  **Call 2 (User Flows):** The prompt instructs the model to generate two distinct user flow diagrams for the core user journey. The required output format is **Mermaid.js syntax**, which can be rendered into clean diagrams on the frontend.
    5.  The frontend displays the two versions of the wireframes (rendered from JSON) and user flows (rendered from Mermaid.js).
    6.  The user selects their preferred version of each.
*   **Input:** The `app_brief.json` from the `State`.
*   **Output:** The selected wireframe JSON and user flow Mermaid.js syntax are added to the `State` object.

#### **Phase 3 Workflow: Code Generation & Prototyping**
*   **Governing Agent:** `FrontendDeveloperAgent`
*   **Objective:** To synthesize all preceding decisions into a functional, client-side web application prototype.
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  The agent receives the final, enriched `State` object containing the app brief and chosen visual designs.
    2.  It prompts a high-reasoning LLM (e.g., Claude 3.5 Sonnet). The prompt contains the full specification and instructs the model to act as an expert frontend developer.
    3.  The model is instructed to generate code for three separate files: `index.html`, `style.css`, and `app.js`.
    4.  The required output format is a single JSON object: `{"index.html": "...", "style.css": "...", "app.js": "..."}`.
    5.  This JSON is passed to the Sandbox Sub-System for execution.
*   **Input:** The fully populated `State` object.
*   **Output:** A JSON object containing the file structure and code for the prototype.

### **4.0 Advanced Sandbox & Execution Environment**

#### **4.1 Enterprise-Grade Security Architecture**
The Genesis Engine implements a multi-layered security approach for code execution:

**Container Security (2025 Best Practices):**
- **Distroless Base Images**: Minimal attack surface with Google's distroless containers
- **Non-Root Execution**: All containers run as unprivileged users with user namespace mapping
- **Multi-Stage Builds**: Separate build and runtime environments for minimal production images
- **Security Scanning**: Integrated Trivy/Snyk scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- **Runtime Security**: seccomp profiles, AppArmor/SELinux policies, and capability dropping

**Resource & Network Isolation:**
- **Resource Quotas**: CPU (0.5 cores), Memory (512MB), Disk (1GB) limits per sandbox
- **Network Segmentation**: Isolated networks with controlled egress for package installation
- **Ephemeral Storage**: Temporary filesystems with automatic cleanup
- **Process Isolation**: PID namespace isolation and process monitoring

**Advanced Execution Capabilities:**
- **Multi-Runtime Support**: Node.js 20+, Python 3.12, Deno, Bun for modern JavaScript
- **Smart Caching**: Layer-based dependency caching with BuildKit
- **Streaming Execution**: Real-time output with WebSocket connections
- **Execution Timeouts**: Configurable limits with graceful termination

#### **4.2 Intelligent Preview & Testing System**
Advanced preview generation with comprehensive testing:

**Modern Preview Features:**
- **Server-Side Rendering**: Next.js App Router with streaming and Suspense
- **Hot Module Replacement**: Sub-second updates with Turbopack
- **Multi-Viewport Testing**: Automated responsive design validation
- **Performance Profiling**: Core Web Vitals monitoring and optimization suggestions
- **Accessibility Automation**: axe-core integration with WCAG 2.2 compliance

**Quality Assurance Integration:**
- **Automated Testing**: Jest, Playwright, and Cypress test generation
- **Code Quality**: ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript strict mode enforcement
- **Security Scanning**: OWASP ZAP integration for vulnerability assessment
- **Performance Budgets**: Lighthouse CI with configurable thresholds

#### **4.3 Step-by-Step Execution Flow**
1.  **Request Reception:** The FastAPI backend receives the code JSON from the `FrontendDeveloperAgent`.
2.  **Temporary Workspace Creation:** A unique, temporary directory is created on the server.
3.  **File Hydration:** The backend writes the `index.html`, `style.css`, and `app.js` files into this directory.
4.  **Dockerfile Generation:** A simple `Dockerfile` is generated on-the-fly. For this MVP, it can be based on a lightweight web server image like `nginx:alpine`:
    ```dockerfile
    FROM nginx:alpine
    COPY . /usr/share/nginx/html
    ```
5.  **Docker Image Build:** The `docker-py` library is used to programmatically execute `docker build` on the temporary directory, tagging the image with a unique ID.
6.  **Container Execution:** The system runs a new container from the freshly built image, mapping the container's port 80 to a random, available high-numbered port on the host machine. Resource limits (CPU, memory) will be applied.
7.  **Proxy & Display:** The FastAPI backend returns the URL of the running container (e.g., `http://<server_ip>:<random_port>`). The Next.js frontend renders this URL within a sandboxed `<iframe>` to display the interactive preview.
8.  **Cleanup:** A background process will be implemented to stop and remove the container and image after a set period of inactivity.

### **5.0 Post-MVP: The Documentation Generation Suite**

*   **Governing Agent:** `TechWriterAgent`
*   **Objective:** To bridge the gap between the generated prototype and a production-ready project by creating professional development documentation.
*   **Workflow:** After a successful prototype generation, the user will be presented with an option to generate a "Project Starter Kit." They can select from a checklist of documents. The `TechWriterAgent` will then synthesize the entire `State` object to produce these documents.
*   **Potential Deliverables:**
    *   **Higher-Level Plan:** A strategic overview of the project.
    *   **Project Architecture Diagram & Spec:** Technical diagrams (using Mermaid.js) and explanations.
    *   **Product Requirements Document (PRD):** A formal document for product stakeholders.
    *   **Technical Specification:** A detailed document for the engineering team.
    *   **Project Phases & Development Roadmap:** A high-level timeline.
    *   **Initial Development Sprints:** A breakdown of the project into sprints with user stories and tasks.
    *   **Selectable Tasks Breakdown:** Actionable development tasks with sample code snippets to begin work.

### **1.0 Introduction**

#### **1.1 Project Overview**
Sentient Core is an advanced AI-driven development platform that transforms natural language requirements into production-ready applications through intelligent multi-agent orchestration. The system combines state-of-the-art LLMs with specialized development agents to automate the entire software development lifecycle. Its initial capabilities and validation will be showcased through participation in the "Raise Your Hack" hackathon, where it will address key enterprise and consumer challenges by leveraging cutting-edge agentic technologies.

#### **1.2 Vision Statement**
To democratize software development by creating an intelligent ecosystem where users can describe their vision in natural language and receive complete, scalable, and maintainable applications with enterprise-grade quality and security. The "Raise Your Hack" competition serves as an initial catalyst to realize key aspects of this vision by delivering tangible, high-impact solutions focused on enterprise agentic workflows, agent-powered e-commerce, and on-device AI utilities.

    *   Integrate the **Tavily API** for advanced, AI-powered product search and market intelligence.
    *   Showcase **voice UI capabilities** for intuitive e-commerce interactions.
3.  **Qualcomm Track - On-Device Edge AI Utility Generator:**
    *   Create an innovative "Edge AI Utility Generator" module within Sentient Core.
    *   Utilize **Groq/Llama 3** for generating Python code for simple, useful consumer utility applications.
    *   Ensure generated utilities are packaged for **Snapdragon X Elite** devices, with core AI functionality running **entirely offline on-device** using **ONNX Runtime** and **ExecuTorch**.
4.  **Cross-Cutting MVP Platform Features:**
    *   A modern, responsive web-based interface (Next.js 15, React 19, Tailwind CSS v4, Shadcn/UI) for users to define requirements, manage agents, and deploy applications.
    *   Demonstrable multi-agent orchestration capabilities, showcasing how different agents (both general and specialized) collaborate to achieve the track-specific deliverables.
    *   Secure, scalable, and robust backend services (FastAPI/Python) supporting the platform's functionalities.

#### **1.4 Target Audience**
*   **Primary:** Technical entrepreneurs, startup founders, and product managers seeking rapid prototyping
*   **Secondary:** Small to medium development teams requiring acceleration and best practices enforcement
*   **Tertiary:** Educational institutions, coding bootcamps, and enterprise innovation labs
*   **Emerging:** Non-technical founders and business analysts with clear product visions

### **3.0 Hackathon Execution Plan**

Our execution strategy for the 'Raise Your Hack' competition is organized into three distinct phases, each building upon the last to deliver a cohesive and powerful demonstration of the Sentient Core platform. This plan provides a high-level overview.

**For a detailed breakdown of sprints, tasks, and timelines, please refer to the official `HACKATHON_ROADMAP.md` document located in `.documents/project planning/roadmaps/`.**

#### **Phase 1: Core Platform & Vultr Deployment**
*   **Objective**: Deploy the core Sentient Core platform on Vultr and demonstrate a foundational enterprise agentic workflow.
*   **Focus**: Infrastructure, backend/frontend services, core agent integration (Groq, Fetch.ai), and CI/CD.

#### **Phase 2: E-Commerce Agent Pack & Knowledge Integration**
*   **Objective**: Develop and integrate the agent-powered e-commerce solution for the Prosus track.
*   **Focus**: Specialized agent development, knowledge graph implementation (ChromaDB), and integration with third-party data services (Tavily).

#### **Phase 3: Edge AI Utility & Final Polish**
*   **Objective**: Implement the on-device AI utility generator for the Qualcomm track and prepare for final submission.
*   **Focus**: On-device model conversion (ONNX Runtime), code generation modules, and final integration testing across all three tracks.

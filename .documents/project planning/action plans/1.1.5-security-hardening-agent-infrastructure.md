**Story ID:** 1.1.5
**Title:** Security Hardening for Agent Infrastructure
**Assigned Agent:** AGENT-SECURITY
**Dependencies:** T1.1.1 (AutoGen/AG2 + LangGraph Integration), T1.1.2 (Core Agent Dev & Execution Env Setup), T1.1.4 (Agent Tooling Framework)

## 1. Acceptance Criteria

- Secure credential management for API keys and secrets is implemented.

- Input validation and output sanitization are implemented for agent interactions and tool usage.
- Secure communication channels (e.g., HTTPS) are used for all external interactions.
- Basic logging and monitoring for security events are in place.
- A threat model for the agent infrastructure has been drafted.

## 2. Detailed Tasks

This action plan expands on tasks T1.1.5.1 - T1.1.5.5 from `task-breakdown.md`, incorporating insights from `ai-data-security-privacy.md` (ADSP), `archon-framework-integration.md` (AFI), `supabase-integration.md` (SI), and `core-framework-integration.md` (CFI).

### Task 1.1.5.1: Implement Secure Credential Management
   - **1.1.5.1.1:** Identify all secrets: API keys (OpenAI, Supabase service key, etc.), database credentials, JWT secrets. (ADSP Section 4.4; AFI Section 3.2; SI Section 3; CFI Section 3.2).
   - **1.1.5.1.2:** Choose a secure secret management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, or environment variables for local/containerized dev, managed secrets in CI/CD and production). (ADSP Section 4.4).
   - **1.1.5.1.3:** Implement retrieval of secrets at runtime by agents and services, ensuring they are not hardcoded or exposed in logs. (AFI Section 3.2, 5.1.2).
   - **1.1.5.1.4:** Define a process for rotating secrets regularly.

### Task 1.1.5.2: Define and Enforce Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
   - **1.1.5.2.1:** Define roles for different types of agents (e.g., `ArchitectAgent`, `CodingAgent`, `ResearchAgent`) and potentially for users interacting with the system. (ADSP Section 4.1).
   - **1.1.5.2.2:** Define permissions associated with each role, specifying what actions agents can perform and what tools/data they can access. (ADSP Section 4.1; AFI Section 5.3.1.A for tool permissions).
   - **1.1.5.2.3:** Implement RBAC enforcement within the agent framework (e.g., LangGraph nodes checking agent roles before executing actions or calling tools). (MAA Section 4.4.2).
   - **1.1.5.2.4:** If using Supabase, leverage RLS to enforce data access based on user/agent roles. (SI Section 2, 4.2.2, 5.3; ADSP Section 7).

### Task 1.1.5.3: Implement Input Validation and Output Sanitization
   - **1.1.5.3.1:** For all agent inputs (from users, other agents, or external sources), implement strict validation using Pydantic models or similar schema validation. (ADSP Section 3.3, 4.3, 7; AFI Section 5.1.3).
   - **1.1.5.3.2:** Sanitize inputs to prevent prompt injection, XSS, or other injection attacks, especially before passing them to LLMs or tools. (ADSP Section 3.3, 4.3).
   - **1.1.5.3.3:** For all agent outputs (LLM responses, tool results), filter and sanitize them to remove sensitive information, PII, or potentially malicious content before displaying to users or passing to other systems/agents. (ADSP Section 3.4, 4.3).
   - **1.1.5.3.4:** Implement context-aware filtering based on the sensitivity of the data and the destination of the output. (ADSP Section 4.3).

### Task 1.1.5.4: Ensure Secure Communication Channels
   - **1.1.5.4.1:** Ensure all external API calls made by agents (e.g., to OpenAI, Supabase, other third-party services) use HTTPS. (ADSP Section 3.5, 4.1).
   - **1.1.5.4.2:** If agents communicate with each other over a network (e.g., via FastAPI endpoints), ensure these communications are encrypted using TLS/SSL. (AFI Section 5.1.2).
   - **1.1.5.4.3:** Configure web servers (e.g., Uvicorn for FastAPI) with proper SSL/TLS certificates. (CFI Section 3.2 for general backend setup).
   - **1.1.5.4.4:** Review and configure CORS policies if agent interfaces or APIs are accessed from different origins. (CFI Section 3.2.4).

### Task 1.1.5.5: Draft Initial Threat Model and Basic Security Monitoring
   - **1.1.5.5.1:** Conduct an initial threat modeling exercise for the multi-agent infrastructure, identifying key assets, potential attackers, attack vectors, and vulnerabilities. (ADSP Section 4.2).
       - Consider threats like data poisoning, model inversion, prompt injection, data leakage, insecure tool interactions. (ADSP Section 3).
   - **1.1.5.5.2:** Implement basic security logging: successful/failed authentication attempts, critical errors, access to sensitive tools/data, potential security events (e.g., repeated failed operations). (ADSP Section 4.4).
       - Ensure logs do not contain sensitive data. (ADSP Section 4.4).
   - **1.1.5.5.3:** Set up basic monitoring and alerting for critical security events (e.g., using Prometheus and Grafana as mentioned in AFI Section 5.7, or other logging/monitoring tools).
   - **1.1.5.5.4:** Document the initial threat model and the implemented security measures.

## 3. Key Considerations & References

- **Defense in Depth:** Apply security measures at multiple layers (network, application, data).
- **Principle of Least Privilege:** Agents and system components should only have the minimum permissions necessary to perform their tasks.
- **Regular Review:** Security is an ongoing process. Plan for regular review and updates to security measures as the system evolves and new threats emerge. (ADSP Section 4.2, 4.4).
- **Compliance:** Keep relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) in mind if PII is handled. (ADSP Section 4.4).

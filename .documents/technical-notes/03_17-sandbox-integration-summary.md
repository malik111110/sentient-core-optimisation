# Technical Summary: Sandbox Tool Integration

**Date:** 2024-07-18

## 1. Objective

The primary goal of this development unit was to integrate the sandbox execution layer (`E2BSandboxTool` and `WebContainerTool`) into the core agentic workflow. This allows specialized agents to execute code and generate artifacts within secure, isolated environments, moving from mock execution to real task performance.

## 2. Process & Key Changes

The integration was accomplished through a series of sequential modifications to the orchestration and agent layers:

1.  **Task Model Update:** The `Task` Pydantic model in `shared_state.py` was updated with an optional `sandbox_type` field. This allows the selected sandbox environment to be persisted and passed through the system.

2.  **Chooser Integration:** The `Chooser` utility was integrated into the `MainOrchestrator`. After a plan is created, the orchestrator iterates through each task, using the `Chooser` to determine the appropriate sandbox (`e2b` or `web-container`) and populating the `sandbox_type` field.

3.  **Base Agent Refactoring:** The `BaseAgent` class in `agents/base_agent.py` was refactored. Its constructor (`__init__`) was modified to accept an optional `sandbox_tool` argument. This established the mechanism for equipping agents with tools.

4.  **Executor Tooling:** The `DepartmentalExecutor` was updated to instantiate both `E2BSandboxTool` and `WebContainerTool`. In its `_execute_single_task` method, it now reads the `sandbox_type` from the task object and passes the corresponding tool instance to the specialized agent's constructor.

5.  **Specialized Agent Modification:** The `FrontendDeveloperAgent` and `BackendDeveloperAgent` were updated to:
    *   Correctly handle the `sandbox_tool` in their constructors.
    *   Implement logic within their `execute_task` methods to call the `run` method of the provided tool, passing the necessary inputs (e.g., a script for E2B, a file tree for WebContainer).

## 3. Validation

A new integration test, `test_orchestrator_integration.py`, was created to validate the entire workflow. Using mocks for the planner and the tool's `run` method, the test confirms:

*   The orchestrator correctly calls the planner.
*   The `Chooser` logic (implicitly tested via the executor's tool selection) routes tasks correctly.
*   The `DepartmentalExecutor` instantiates agents with the correct tools.
*   The agents call their respective tools with the correct inputs.

The successful execution of this test validates that the integration is functionally complete and robust.

## 4. Broader Impact

This integration marks a significant milestone, transitioning the Sentient Core project from a theoretical planning system to a functional execution system. Agents can now perform real work, paving the way for more complex, multi-step development tasks.

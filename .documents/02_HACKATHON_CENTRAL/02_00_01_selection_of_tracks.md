These amazing devices ship very soon ‚Äì on June 30th, with next-day delivery, so it's your LAST CHANCE.

To submit the Track Selection Form on behalf of your squad:
üéØ Pick your top 3 preferred Industry Tracks. Think strategically ‚Äì where can your team truly shine? Make sure Qualcomm is in there if you want the hardware!

‚ö°Ô∏è Deep Dive: The Qualcomm Track 
This is your chance to build a powerful, AI-driven utility app for everyday users‚Äîright at the edge. You'll develop a consumer-facing application that runs entirely on-device using the Snapdragon X Elite platform. The challenge is to harness the power of Edge AI to create a tool that is both useful and accessible to a broad audience‚Äîwithout relying on cloud connectivity.
We're looking for enterprise-ready, agentic & autonomous solutions focused on the future of work. Your app should be consumer-oriented, utility-focused, Edge AI-powered (using computer vision, audio processing, or generative AI locally), and cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux compatible). You'll include a GitHub repo with setup instructions and focus on functionality and innovation.

üèÜ Qualcomm Prizes: Beyond Incredible!

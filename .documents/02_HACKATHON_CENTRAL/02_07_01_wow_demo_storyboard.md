**Project:** Sentient-Core builds "PharmaPulse"

---

### Scene 1: The Vision (30 seconds)

*   **Visual:** Clean title slide with "Sentient-Core: The Agentic Factory" logo.
*   **Presenter:** "Building sophisticated software is complex, slow, and expensive. What if we could change that? What if we could turn a single idea into a production-ready application, autonomously? Today, we're not just showing you a new app. We're showing you a new way to build."

### Scene 2: The Spark (30 seconds)

*   **Visual:** Split screen. Left: Presenter. Right: A clean UI with a large microphone icon.
*   **Presenter:** "This is Sentient-Core. It all starts with a single command."
*   **(Action):** Presenter activates voice command.
*   **Voice Command (Clear & Crisp):** *"Sentient-Core, build me a competitive intelligence dashboard for the pharmaceutical sector. I need to track recent clinical trials and market sentiment for top pharma companies."

### Scene 3: The Factory Awakens (60 seconds)

*   **Visual:** The UI transforms into a dynamic graph visualization representing the Sentient-Core hierarchy.
*   **Presenter:** "That single command is now being processed by our agentic economy. At the top, a 'C-Suite' of planning agents, built with CrewAI, analyzes the request and creates a high-level project plan."
*   **(Action):** The graph animates. The top node (C-Suite) pulses, then sends tasks down to mid-level nodes labeled "Research," "Data," "Development."
*   **Presenter:** "The plan is delegated to specialized 'Departmental' agents, built with LangGraph, who manage the execution of the entire workflow, from research to deployment."

### Scene 4: The Economy at Work (90 seconds)

*   **Visual:** A dynamic dashboard view. A feed shows live updates from agents. A WebContainer shows code being written and the UI taking shape.
*   **Presenter:** "Now, the worker agents get to work. Our 'ResearchAgent' is using Tavily to scrape the web for the latest clinical trial data. The 'DataAgent' is structuring that information. And our 'DeveloperAgents' are building the application in real-time."
*   **(Action):** Show the WebContainer on the right, where a Next.js frontend with DaisyUI components is visibly being constructed. The agent feed on the left shows messages like `[ResearchAgent] Found 15 new trials for Pfizer.` `[FrontendDeveloperAgent] Creating data visualization component.`
*   **Presenter:** "What you're seeing is the future of software developmentâ€”a transparent, autonomous, and collaborative process performed by AI. This is all powered by best-in-class on-device models like Microsoft's Phi-3, running seamlessly on the local hardware."

### Scene 5: The Final Product (60 seconds)

*   **Visual:** The agent feed shows `[Orchestrator] Build complete. Deploying to Vultr.` The screen transitions to a full-screen view of the final, polished "PharmaPulse" dashboard, live at a public URL.
*   **Presenter:** "And here is the result. A fully functional, deployed 'PharmaPulse' dashboard, created from a single command in just a few minutes."
*   **(Action):** Presenter briefly interacts with the dashboard, clicking on a company to see its latest trial data and sentiment score.

### Scene 6: The Pillars of Power (30 seconds)

*   **Visual:** A slide with three logos: Prosus, Qualcomm, Vultr.
*   **Presenter:** "This entire demonstration showcases a true **Agentic Economy in Production (Prosus)**. The factory itself runs on a single, powerful **Snapdragon-powered PC (Qualcomm)**, turning it into an AI foundry. And the final product is deployed to **enterprise-grade cloud infrastructure (Vultr)**. This is a complete, end-to-end, production-ready solution."

### Scene 7: Conclusion (30 seconds)

*   **Visual:** Final title slide.
*   **Presenter:** "Sentient-Core represents a fundamental shift in how we create value. We invite you to imagine the possibilities when any idea can be transformed into reality, autonomously. Thank you."

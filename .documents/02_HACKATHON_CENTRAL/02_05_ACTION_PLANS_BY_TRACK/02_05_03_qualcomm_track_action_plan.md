**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** June 18, 2025
**Status:** Initial Draft

---

## 1. Objective

To design and build a practical, high-performance Edge AI utility that runs entirely on-device, leveraging the power of Snapdragon hardware. This plan details the steps to meet the Qualcomm sponsor track requirements, focusing on offline-first capabilities and efficient on-device inference.

## 2. Key Technologies

- **Inference Runtime:** ONNX Runtime
- **Execution Provider:** Qualcomm QNN Execution Provider
- **Model Format:** ONNX (`.ort`)
- **Target Hardware:** Snapdragon X Elite
- **Application:** Python (e.g., using Tkinter or a simple web server for UI)

## 3. Action Steps

### Phase 1: Research & Model Selection (Lead: AGENT-RESEARCH)

1.  **Select a Suitable AI Model:**
    *   [ ] Identify a small, efficient model suitable for an on-device utility (e.g., a code snippet generator, a text summarizer, or an image classifier).
    *   [ ] The model must be convertible to the ONNX format.
    *   [ ] Prioritize models with a good balance of performance and accuracy.

2.  **Research ONNX Runtime & QNN:**
    *   [ ] Review the official documentation for ONNX Runtime and the Qualcomm QNN Execution Provider.
    *   [ ] Understand the process for converting models to the `.ort` format and quantizing them for performance.

### Phase 2: Model Conversion & Optimization (Lead: AGENT-AI)

1.  **Convert Model to ONNX Format:**
    *   [ ] Obtain the pre-trained model (e.g., from Hugging Face).
    *   [ ] Use the appropriate tools (e.g., `torch.onnx.export`) to convert the model to the ONNX format.

2.  **Quantize and Optimize the Model:**
    *   [ ] Apply quantization techniques (e.g., dynamic or static quantization) to reduce the model size and improve inference speed.
    *   [ ] The final model should be saved in the `.ort` format, ready for use with ONNX Runtime.

### Phase 3: Application Development (Lead: AGENT-BACKEND)

1.  **Build the Core Utility Application:**
    *   [ ] Create a simple Python application that will host the on-device model.
    *   [ ] The application will provide a basic user interface for interacting with the model (e.g., a text input for a prompt).

2.  **Integrate ONNX Runtime:**
    *   [ ] Add the ONNX Runtime dependency to the application.
    *   [ ] Write the code to load the `.ort` model and create an inference session.
    *   [ ] Configure the inference session to use the Qualcomm QNN Execution Provider.

3.  **Implement Inference Logic:**
    *   [ ] Create the logic to preprocess user input, run inference on the model, and post-process the output.
    *   [ ] Ensure the entire process runs offline, without any reliance on cloud services.

### Phase 4: Testing & Demonstration (Lead: AGENT-ARCHITECT)

1.  **Test on Target Hardware:**
    *   [ ] If possible, test the application on a device with a Snapdragon X Elite processor to validate performance.
    *   [ ] If target hardware is not available, test on a standard machine and document the expected performance gains on Snapdragon.

2.  **Prepare Demonstration:**
    *   [ ] Create a demonstration that clearly shows the utility running entirely on-device.
    *   [ ] Highlight the speed and efficiency of the on-device inference.
    *   [ ] Explain how the utility could be integrated into a larger application or operating system.

## 4. Connecting to Our Users

Developing an Edge AI Utility for the Qualcomm track aligns with Sentient Core's principle of **Unconstrained Innovation** and demonstrates its adaptability to diverse technological frontiers, benefiting our user personas (see `../../../00_CONCEPTUAL_FRAMEWORK/00_03_user_personas.md`):

*   **For Alex, The Technical Entrepreneur:** The ability of Sentient Core to generate utilities for edge devices like those powered by Snapdragon X Elite opens up new avenues for Alex. It means the platform isn't limited to cloud-based applications but can help create products that leverage the unique capabilities of on-device AI (offline functionality, low latency, privacy). This expands the potential market and types of solutions Alex can build rapidly.

*   **For Morgan, The Development Team Lead:** The Qualcomm track showcases how Sentient Core can assist Morgan's team in exploring and adopting new technologies like on-device inference with ONNX Runtime and specialized hardware EPs (QNN). Instead of a steep learning curve for each new platform, Sentient Core can abstract some of the complexity, allowing the team to prototype and build for edge devices more efficiently. This helps keep the team's skills current and enables them to tackle a wider range of projects.

While the immediate deliverable is a specific utility, the underlying message is that Sentient Core is designed to be extensible and to empower users to innovate across the full spectrum of computing environments, from cloud to edge.

# Qualcomm Track Action Plan (Supporting Role): The On-Device AI Foundry

**Version:** 3.0 (Strategic Pivot)
**Date:** June 19, 2025
**Status:** Active
**Parent Epic:** EPIC-QUALCOMM-SUPPORT (Showcase High-Performance Local Orchestration)

---

## 1. Objective

In our new strategy, the Qualcomm track serves a crucial **supporting role**. The objective is to demonstrate that the entire **Sentient-Core "agentic factory"**—a complex, multi-agent orchestration platform—can run efficiently and effectively on a single, powerful Snapdragon X Elite-powered device. This frames the hardware not just as a client device, but as a self-contained, high-performance **AI Software Foundry**.

## 2. Stories & Detailed Tasks

### STORY-QUALCOMM-1: On-Device Factory Demonstration
*   **Description:** Prepare and execute the full "PharmaPulse" factory demo on the Snapdragon loaner PC.
*   **Assigned:** AGENT-ARCHITECT, AGENT-DEVOPS
*   **Tasks:**
    *   **Task-1.1:** Set up the complete Sentient-Core development and execution environment on the Snapdragon device.
    *   **Task-1.2:** Run the full demo script from the Prosus master plan, initiating the build of the "PharmaPulse" dashboard locally.
    *   **Task-1.3:** Benchmark the performance: measure total time, CPU/NPU utilization during peak agent activity, and memory footprint.
    *   **Task-1.4:** Prepare talking points and visuals that highlight the hardware's ability to handle this demanding, next-generation AI workload.

## 3. Success Criteria

*   The entire Sentient-Core platform runs smoothly on the Snapdragon device.
*   The "PharmaPulse" application is successfully built locally by the agentic factory.
*   We have clear performance benchmarks demonstrating the hardware's capabilities.
*   The narrative that a Snapdragon device can serve as a powerful, private, all-in-one AI development and orchestration machine is clearly and compellingly communicated.

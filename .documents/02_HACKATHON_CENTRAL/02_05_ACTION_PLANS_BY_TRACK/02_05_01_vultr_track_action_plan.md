# Vultr Track Action Plan (Supporting Role): Production Deployment Target

**Version:** 3.0 (Strategic Pivot)
**Date:** June 19, 2025
**Status:** Active
**Parent Epic:** EPIC-VULTR-SUPPORT (Deploy the Factory's Product)

---

## 1. Objective

In our new strategy, the Vultr track serves a critical **supporting role** by acting as the **production deployment target**. The objective is to prove that the application built by our **Sentient-Core "agentic factory"** is not just a demo, but a real, production-ready application that can be deployed to enterprise-grade cloud infrastructure. This completes the end-to-end story from concept to production.

## 2. Stories & Detailed Tasks

### STORY-VULTR-1: Prepare the Production Environment
*   **Description:** Configure the Vultr cloud environment to be ready to receive the application.
*   **Assigned:** AGENT-DEVOPS
*   **Tasks:**
    *   **Task-1.1:** Provision a Vultr cloud server.
    *   **Task-1.2:** Set up Docker, Docker Compose, and Nginx as a reverse proxy.
    *   **Task-1.3:** Configure DNS and SSL for a public-facing URL.

### STORY-VULTR-2: Deploy the "PharmaPulse" Dashboard
*   **Description:** Receive the application artifacts from the agentic factory and deploy them.
*   **Assigned:** AGENT-DEVOPS
*   **Tasks:**
    *   **Task-2.1:** Create a script or CI/CD hook that listens for the completion signal from the Sentient-Core orchestrator.
    *   **Task-2.2:** Automatically pull the generated frontend and backend code (the "PharmaPulse" dashboard).
    *   **Task-2.3:** Build the Docker images for the application and launch them using Docker Compose.
    *   **Task-2.4:** Verify that the application is live and accessible at its public URL.

## 3. Success Criteria

*   The Vultr environment is successfully configured and secured.
*   The "PharmaPulse" dashboard, once built by the agentic factory, is automatically deployed to the Vultr server.
*   The deployed application is functional and publicly accessible via a URL.
*   The demo clearly shows the final step of the factory's workflow: a live, deployed, production-grade application.

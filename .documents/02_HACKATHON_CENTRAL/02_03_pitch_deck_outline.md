**Slide 1: Title Slide**
*   **Project Name:** Sentient Core
*   **Event:** Raise Your Hack
*   **Team Name/Members:** (Placeholder - TBD)
*   **Date:** (Placeholder - Event Date)
*   **Logos:** Sentient Core, Raise Your Hack, Vultr, Prosus, Qualcomm, Meta, Groq, Fetch.ai, Coral Protocol (tastefully arranged)

**Slide 2: The Problem / The Opportunity**
*   **Problem Statement (Concise):**
    *   **The Great Divide in Digital Creation:** Industry experts have vision but face a "translation gap" to technical execution. Current AI tools force a compromise: powerful but inaccessible pro-code platforms, or simple but unsophisticated low-code tools (The 'Pro-Code Trap' & 'Low-Code Trap'). (Ref: `../../00_CONCEPTUAL_FRAMEWORK/00_02_story_concepts_painpoints.md`)
    *   This friction is a major bottleneck to innovation, preventing the realization of truly targeted and effective digital solutions.
*   **Opportunity:**
    *   To **Democratize Creation** and **Automate Complexity** (Ref: `../../00_CONCEPTUAL_FRAMEWORK/00_01_vision_and_mission.md`) by building an advanced agentic development platform.
    *   To create a **Symbiotic Platform** that offers both power and ease of use, translating human intent directly into enterprise-grade digital reality.

**Slide 3: Our Solution: Sentient Core - The Agentic Nexus**
*   **Core Concept:** Sentient Core is an **Enterprise Agentic Workflow Platform** and a **Symbiotic Platform** (Ref: `../../00_CONCEPTUAL_FRAMEWORK/00_02_story_concepts_painpoints.md`), designed to empower users to rapidly design, build, deploy, and manage intelligent AI agents and multi-agent systems by translating human vision into digital reality.
*   **Visual:** High-level architecture diagram of Sentient Core, emphasizing its Six Pillars (Dynamic Team Composition, Agent-of-Agents, Persistent Context, Stateful Orchestration, Systemic Observability, Adaptive UX).
*   **Key Value Propositions (Guided by Core Principles - `../../00_CONCEPTUAL_FRAMEWORK/00_01_vision_and_mission.md`):**
    *   **Human-Centric Accelerated Innovation:** Go from idea to deployed AI solution faster, keeping the user's vision central.
    *   **Enhanced Productivity through Automation:** Automate complex development tasks, freeing human creativity.
    *   **Quality by Design in an Integrated Ecosystem:** Seamlessly combine diverse AI capabilities and technologies to build robust, secure, and maintainable applications.

**Slide 4: Addressing the 'Raise Your Hack' Challenge**
*   **Statement:** "Sentient Core is uniquely positioned to tackle the 'Raise Your Hack' challenge by integrating three distinct sponsor tracks into a cohesive and powerful narrative."
*   **Visual:** Logos of Vultr, Prosus, Qualcomm prominently displayed, with connecting lines to a central Sentient Core logo.
*   **Briefly state the three tracks being addressed.**

**Slide 5: Core Technology Stack - The Powerhouse Within**
*   **Headline:** Leveraging Best-in-Class Sponsor Technologies
*   **Meta Llama 3 via Groq API:**
    *   **Role:** Advanced reasoning, complex instruction following, code generation, natural language understanding.
    *   **Benefit:** Unprecedented speed and intelligence for our agents.
*   **Fetch.ai (uAgents / Agentverse):**
    *   **Role:** Agent registration, discovery, and decentralized communication.
    *   **Benefit:** Enables Sentient Core agents to join a wider, interoperable agent ecosystem.
*   **Coral Protocol:**
    *   **Role:** Standardized, robust, thread-style collaboration for inter-agent communication.
    *   **Benefit:** Facilitates complex multi-agent tasks and reliable coordination.
*   **Mention Key Existing Tech:** Python, Archon Framework (our flexible agent framework), LangGraph (for stateful, graph-based orchestration).

**Slide 6: Vultr Track - Enterprise Agentic Workflow Platform**
*   **Track Focus:** Agentic Workflows for the Future of Work.
*   **Our Solution:** The core Sentient Core platform, deployed scalably on **Vultr infrastructure**.
*   **Demonstration:** An "Automated Market Research & Competitor Analysis Agent."
    *   **Function:** Autonomously gathers market data, analyzes trends using Llama 3 on Groq, generates insightful reports.
    *   **Benefit for Enterprise:** Empowers teams with actionable intelligence, saves time.
*   **Vultr Advantage:** Highlighting reliable, scalable, and performant cloud infrastructure for demanding AI workloads.

**Slide 7: Prosus Track - Agent-Powered E-Commerce Reimagined**
*   **Track Focus:** Design an Agent-Powered E-Commerce App.
*   **Our Solution:** An **AI-Powered E-Commerce Agent Pack** built using Sentient Core.
*   **Key Innovations:**
    *   **Knowledge Graph User Profiles:** Deeply personalized experiences based on dynamic user KGs (built with RDFLib).
    *   **Tavily API Integration:** Advanced, AI-native search for product discovery and comparison.
    *   **Collaborative Agents (Fetch.ai & Coral):** Agents for discovery, recommendation, and order assistance working together.
*   **Demonstration:** A "Smart Food Ordering" or "Curated Travel Booking" assistant.
*   **Prosus Advantage:** Showcasing next-generation e-commerce that is intelligent, personalized, and efficient.

**Slide 8: Qualcomm Track - Generating On-Device Edge AI Utilities**
*   **Track Focus:** Edge AI Consumer Utility Application on Snapdragon X Elite.
*   **Our Solution:** An **Edge AI Utility Generator** module within the Sentient Core platform.
*   **How it Works:**
    1.  User defines utility needs in Sentient Core (cloud platform).
    2.  Sentient Core uses Llama 3 on Groq (and/or Code Llama) to **generate Python code** for the on-device application.
    3.  Generated utility (e.g., image sorter, offline text tool) runs **entirely on-device and offline** on Snapdragon X Elite (using ONNX Runtime or similar).
*   **Key Differentiator:** The Groq/Llama 3 dependency is for the *generation phase* in the cloud; the *edge application's core AI is offline*, meeting the track's critical constraint.
*   **Qualcomm Advantage:** Demonstrating rapid development of practical, offline-first AI utilities tailored for Snapdragon X Elite's capabilities.

**Slide 9: The Integrated Vision - Synergy in Action (Optional)**

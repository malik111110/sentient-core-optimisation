# FastAPI - Developer Guide

This guide provides a developer-focused overview of FastAPI, a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python 3.8+ based on standard Python type hints. Information is synthesized from the official documentation at `fastapi.tiangolo.com`.

## 1. Core Concepts

FastAPI is built on two primary foundations:
*   **Starlette:** For all the high-performance asynchronous web tooling.
*   **Pydantic:** For all the data validation, serialization, and documentation based on Python type hints.

**Key Features:**
*   **Fast:** Very high performance, on par with NodeJS and Go, thanks to Starlette and Pydantic.
*   **Fast to code:** Increases development speed significantly.
*   **Fewer bugs:** Reduces human-induced errors due to type hints and editor support.
*   **Intuitive:** Great editor support with autocompletion everywhere.
*   **Robust:** Get production-ready code with automatic interactive documentation.

## 2. First Steps: A Basic API

Creating a FastAPI application is straightforward.

```python
# main.py
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

# 1. Create a FastAPI instance
app = FastAPI()

# 2. Define a Pydantic model for data validation
class Item(BaseModel):
    name: str
    price: float
    is_offer: bool | None = None

# 3. Create a path operation (or "route") using a decorator
@app.get("/")
async def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World"}

# Path parameters are declared in the path string
@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
async def read_item(item_id: int, q: str | None = None): # Query params are function args
    return {"item_id": item_id, "q": q}

# Request body is defined using the Pydantic model
@app.put("/items/{item_id}")
async def update_item(item_id: int, item: Item):
    return {"item_name": item.name, "item_id": item_id}
```

**To run this:**
1.  Install FastAPI and an ASGI server: `pip install fastapi "uvicorn[standard]"`
2.  Run the server: `uvicorn main:app --reload`

## 3. Asynchronous Support

FastAPI is built from the ground up to support asynchronous code. If you are performing I/O-bound operations (like calling an external API, querying a database), you should declare your path operation functions with `async def`.

```python
@app.get("/slow-data")
async def get_slow_data():
    # 'await' can be used to call other async functions without blocking
    result = await some_async_library.fetch_data()
    return result
```
If your code is CPU-bound or uses a library that doesn't support `asyncio`, you can define it as a normal `def` function. FastAPI is smart enough to run it in an external threadpool to avoid blocking the server's event loop.

## 4. Data Validation with Pydantic

FastAPI uses Pydantic models to define the shape of your data. When you type-hint a parameter with a Pydantic model, FastAPI automatically:
1.  Reads the request body as JSON.
2.  Converts the types to your declared Python types.
3.  Validates the data. If invalid, it returns a clear JSON error message.
4.  Provides the validated data in the parameter (e.g., `item` in the `update_item` example).
5.  Generates a JSON Schema for your model, which is used in the API documentation.

## 5. Dependency Injection

FastAPI has a powerful but simple Dependency Injection system. It helps you manage shared logic, database connections, authentication, and more. You create a dependency as a function and "inject" it into your path operations using `Depends`.

```python
from fastapi import Depends, FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

# This is a dependency
async def common_parameters(q: str | None = None, skip: int = 0, limit: int = 100):
    return {"q": q, "skip": skip, "limit": limit}

@app.get("/items/")
async def read_items(commons: dict = Depends(common_parameters)):
    # The result of common_parameters is injected into 'commons'
    return {"items": ..., "params": commons}
```

## 6. Automatic API Documentation

One of FastAPI's most beloved features is its automatic, interactive API documentation. Once your server is running, you can access:
*   **Swagger UI:** at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`
*   **ReDoc:** at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc`

This documentation is generated automatically from your path operations, Pydantic models, and dependency definitions.

## 7. Summary for Hackathon Implementation

For the **Vultr Enterprise Agentic Workflow** track, FastAPI is the ideal choice for the backend API server.
*   It will serve as the entry point for requests from the Next.js frontend.
*   It will orchestrate the agentic workflows by interacting with the backend clients (`GroqService`, `FetchAIAdapter`, etc.).
*   Its `async` capabilities are perfect for managing long-running agent tasks and external API calls without blocking.
*   Pydantic models will ensure that all data flowing between the frontend, backend, and agents is well-defined and valid.

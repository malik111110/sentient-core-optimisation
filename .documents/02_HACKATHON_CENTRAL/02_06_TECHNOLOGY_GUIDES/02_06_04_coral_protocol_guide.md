# Coral Protocol - Developer Guide

This guide provides an overview of the Coral Protocol, focusing on its core concepts and how it facilitates AI agent collaboration. Information is synthesized from the official Coral Protocol documentation (docs.coralprotocol.org).

## 1. What is Coral Protocol?

Coral Protocol is designed as a **collaboration infrastructure for AI agents**. Its primary goal is to enable seamless communication, coordination, trust, and potentially payments within an "Internet of Agents." It aims to be a practical solution for integrating agent capabilities into software applications and lays groundwork for safe Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).

Key features include:
*   **Open Collaboration:** Allows agent creators to publish "agent advertisements" which can be discovered and used on-demand by other agents or multi-agent applications.
*   **Comprehensive Support:** Provides the necessary components for agent collaboration: communication, coordination, trust mechanisms, and payment frameworks.
*   **Framework Agnostic:** Agents can be built using any programming language or framework. Coral Protocol focuses on the interaction layer.
*   **MCP Support:** Compatible with technologies and frameworks that support the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## 2. Core Concepts

### a. Coral Server

The Coral Server is the **decentralized coordination layer** of the ecosystem. It is central to the protocol's operation and is responsible for:
*   **Agent Execution Management:** Overseeing how and when agents run.
*   **Structured Messaging:** Ensuring messages are correctly routed and formatted.
*   **Memory Handling:** Managing memory scope and access levels for agents (e.g., private vs. shared memory).
*   **Inter-Agent Collaboration:** Facilitating complex interactions between multiple agents.
*   **Agent Registry:** Maintaining a directory of all "Coralized" agents, including their capabilities and how to interact with them.
*   **Communication Flow:** All messages, tasks, and threads within the Coral Ecosystem pass through the Coral Server.

Application developers can co-deploy an application-local Coral Server within their private network, alongside their existing backends.

### b. Coral Agents

Coral Agents are **autonomous software entities** within the protocol.
*   **Decentralized ID (DID):** Each agent possesses a unique decentralized identifier.
*   **Declared Capabilities:** Agents advertise their functionalities and services.
*   **Standardized Operation:** They operate using standard messaging formats and secure coordination mechanisms provided by the Coral Server.
*   **"Coralization":** Existing agents (e.g., Fetch.ai uAgents, custom agents) can be adapted or "Coralized" to become part of the Coral ecosystem.

### c. Agent Discovery

A crucial aspect of the protocol is enabling agents and applications to find and utilize other agents.
*   **Agent Advertisements:** Agent creators publish advertisements detailing their agent's services.
*   **On-Demand Use:** Other agents or applications can discover these advertisements and immediately use the advertised agent's capabilities.

### d. Communication Threads

All communication involving agents and users is organized into **scoped threads**.
*   The Coral Server is responsible for routing messages within these threads between the appropriate parties.

### e. Identity, Roles & Memory

*   **Identity:** Agents have DIDs. The specifics of roles are less detailed in the initial overview but are a listed core concept.
*   **Memory:** The Coral Server manages memory access for agents, distinguishing between:
    *   **Private memory:** Accessible only by the agent itself.
    *   *(Shared/scoped memory is implied for collaboration but needs further detail from deeper docs if available).*

## 3. Ecosystem Actors

The Coral ecosystem involves several key types of participants:

*   **Agent Developers:** Individuals or teams that create, maintain, and "Coralize" agents. This can include application developers sharing their work, dedicated agent builders, or those creating connectors for existing open-source agents.
*   **Agents:** The software entities themselves that have been integrated into the Coral Protocol.
*   **Application Developers:** Those who build applications that leverage Coral-compatible agents to provide advanced features or services.
*   **Application Backends:** Existing server-side components of applications. Coral is designed to integrate with these, often by deploying a local Coral Server instance.

## 4. How to Integrate (Server-Side)

Based on the `coral-server` GitHub repository, here are the concrete steps to run the server component. 

**Disclaimer:** As of the latest review, the Coral Protocol project is in its early stages. The `coral-server` is available, but a corresponding public Python client (`interface-agent`) is not. Therefore, the client-side integration remains conceptual until a client library is released.

### a. Running the Coral Server

The server is a Java application that can be run from the command line.

1.  **Download the Server:** Obtain the `coral-server.jar` file from the project's releases.
2.  **Run the Server:** Execute the following command in your terminal. The `sse` mode (Server-Sent Events) is recommended for use with the MCP Inspector.

    ```bash
    java -jar coral-server.jar --mode sse --port 8080
    ```

3.  **Connect with MCP Inspector:** Once running, you can connect to the server using an MCP inspection tool at the SSE URL: `http://localhost:8080/sse`.

### b. Available MCP Tools (Server-Side)

The `coral-server` exposes the following tools for agents to use:

*   **Agent Registration**
    *   `register_agent`: Registers an agent with the system.

*   **Thread Management**
    *   `create_thread`: Create a new thread with participants.
    *   `add_participant`: Add a participant to a thread.
    *   `remove_participant`: Remove a participant from a thread.
    *   `close_thread`: Close a thread with a summary.

*   **Messaging**
    *   `send_message`: Send a message to a thread.
    *   `wait_for_mentions`: Wait for new messages mentioning an agent.

### c. Client-Side Integration (Conceptual)

A Python client would interact with these tools by making requests to the running Coral Server. For example, it would call the `register_agent` tool to make itself known to the agent society and then use `send_message` to communicate within a thread. Without a public client library, the exact implementation details cannot be documented.

## 5. Key Benefits

*   **Simplified Multi-Agent Orchestration:** Abstracts away the complexities of agent networking, task management, and memory tracking.
*   **Interoperability:** Enables agents built with different technologies to collaborate.
*   **Reusability:** Promotes the sharing and reuse of agent capabilities.
*   **Foundation for Complex Systems:** Provides building blocks for sophisticated multi-agent applications.

# Sentient Core - Infographic Concepts

This document outlines the content and visual flow for three key infographics designed to explain the Sentient Core platform in a compelling and easily digestible format for the hackathon presentation.

---

### Infographic 1: The Sentient Core Ecosystem

**Objective:** To provide a high-level, one-glance overview of the entire platform and how it addresses the three hackathon tracks.

**Visual Style:** A central hub-and-spoke diagram. The "Sentient Core Platform" is the hub. Spokes connect to the three track-specific solutions.

**Content:**

1.  **Central Hub: Sentient Core Platform (on Vultr)**
    *   **Icon:** Brain with circuits.
    *   **Keywords:** Agentic Workflow Orchestration, Development Environment, Monitoring & Management.
    *   **Core Tech:** Python, Archon, LangGraph, Groq API (Llama 3).

2.  **Spoke 1: Prosus E-Commerce Agent Pack**
    *   **Icon:** Shopping cart with a knowledge graph overlay.
    *   **Flow:** Shows data flowing from "User Interactions" to a "Knowledge Graph Profile," which informs "Personalized Agent Actions."
    *   **Tech Callouts:** Tavily API, Fetch.ai, Coral Protocol.

3.  **Spoke 2: Qualcomm Edge AI Utility Generator**
    *   **Icon:** A factory arm building a smartphone app.
    *   **Flow:** A simple 3-step process: (1) Define utility in Sentient Core -> (2) AI-Powered Code Generation (Llama 3) -> (3) Deploy Offline-First App to Snapdragon Device.
    *   **Tech Callouts:** ONNX Runtime, Python.

4.  **Spoke 3: Enterprise Solutions**
    *   **Icon:** A briefcase or factory building.
    *   **Flow:** Illustrates a sample workflow, like "Automated Market Research," showing data inputs, agent analysis, and report outputs.
    *   **Benefit:** "Actionable Intelligence, Accelerated."

### Infographic 2: The Agent Lifecycle - From Concept to Deployment

**Objective:** To walk the audience through the user journey of creating a single agent using Sentient Core.

**Visual Style:** A horizontal, step-by-step flowchart.

**Content:**

*   **Step 1: Define**
    *   **Visual:** A user at a terminal or UI, writing a simple prompt.
    *   **Text:** "Define your agent's goal in plain English. What problem should it solve?"

*   **Step 2: Configure**
    *   **Visual:** A UI showing toggles and dropdowns for selecting tools and models.
    *   **Text:** "Select tools (e.g., web search, database access), models (Llama 3 via Groq), and collaboration protocols (Coral)."

*   **Step 3: Generate & Refine**
    *   **Visual:** An animation showing code being written automatically.
    *   **Text:** "Sentient Core's AI generates the agent's underlying code and logic graph."

*   **Step 4: Test & Sandbox**
    *   **Visual:** A diagram of the agent running inside a secure WebContainer.
    *   **Text:** "Safely test your agent's behavior in an isolated environment before deployment."

*   **Step 5: Deploy**
    *   **Visual:** An icon showing the agent being pushed to the cloud (Vultr) or an edge device.
    *   **Text:** "Deploy your agent with one click to our scalable infrastructure."

### Infographic 3: The Cloud-to-Edge Pipeline (Qualcomm Track)

**Objective:** To clearly explain how we meet the Qualcomm track's "offline-first" requirement while still using powerful cloud AI.

**Visual Style:** A split diagram with a clear line separating "Cloud (Sentient Core Platform)" and "Edge (Snapdragon Device)."

**Content:**

*   **Cloud Side (Development Phase):**
    *   **Icons:** Groq, Llama 3, Sentient Core Logo.
    *   **Process:** User defines a utility -> Llama 3 generates Python code -> Code is compiled with an ONNX model.
    *   **Text:** "Leveraging cloud-scale AI for automated code generation."

*   **Edge Side (Runtime Phase):**
    *   **Icons:** Snapdragon Logo, an icon for the generated app (e.g., a photo gallery).
    *   **Process:** The compiled app runs locally. An arrow shows data (e.g., local photos) being processed by the on-device ONNX model.
    *   **Text:** "Core AI functionality runs 100% offline. No internet connection required."
    *   **Key Message:** **"Cloud for Creation, Edge for Execution."**

*   **Briefly state the three tracks being addressed.**

**Slide 5: Core Technology Stack - The Powerhouse Within**
*   **Headline:** Leveraging Best-in-Class Sponsor Technologies
*   **Meta Llama 3 via Groq API:**
    *   **Role:** Advanced reasoning, complex instruction following, code generation, natural language understanding.
    *   **Benefit:** Unprecedented speed and intelligence for our agents.
*   **Fetch.ai (uAgents / Agentverse):**
    *   **Role:** Agent registration, discovery, and decentralized communication.
    *   **Benefit:** Enables Snoob-Dev agents to join a wider, interoperable agent ecosystem.
*   **Coral Protocol:**
    *   **Role:** Standardized, robust, thread-style collaboration for inter-agent communication.
    *   **Benefit:** Facilitates complex multi-agent tasks and reliable coordination.
*   **Mention Key Existing Tech:** Python, Archon Framework (our flexible agent framework), LangGraph (for stateful, graph-based orchestration).

**Slide 6: Vultr Track - Enterprise Agentic Workflow Platform**
*   **Track Focus:** Agentic Workflows for the Future of Work.
*   **Our Solution:** The core Snoob-Dev platform, deployed scalably on **Vultr infrastructure**.
*   **Demonstration:** An "Automated Market Research & Competitor Analysis Agent."
    *   **Function:** Autonomously gathers market data, analyzes trends using Llama 3 on Groq, generates insightful reports.
    *   **Benefit for Enterprise:** Empowers teams with actionable intelligence, saves time.
*   **Vultr Advantage:** Highlighting reliable, scalable, and performant cloud infrastructure for demanding AI workloads.

**Slide 7: Prosus Track - Agent-Powered E-Commerce Reimagined**
*   **Track Focus:** Design an Agent-Powered E-Commerce App.
*   **Our Solution:** An **AI-Powered E-Commerce Agent Pack** built using Snoob-Dev.
*   **Key Innovations:**
    *   **Knowledge Graph User Profiles:** Deeply personalized experiences based on dynamic user KGs (built with RDFLib).
    *   **Tavily API Integration:** Advanced, AI-native search for product discovery and comparison.
    *   **Collaborative Agents (Fetch.ai & Coral):** Agents for discovery, recommendation, and order assistance working together.
*   **Demonstration:** A "Smart Food Ordering" or "Curated Travel Booking" assistant.
*   **Prosus Advantage:** Showcasing next-generation e-commerce that is intelligent, personalized, and efficient.

**Slide 8: Qualcomm Track - Generating On-Device Edge AI Utilities**
*   **Track Focus:** Edge AI Consumer Utility Application on Snapdragon X Elite.
*   **Our Solution:** An **Edge AI Utility Generator** module within the Snoob-Dev platform.
*   **How it Works:**
    1.  User defines utility needs in Snoob-Dev (cloud platform).
    2.  Snoob-Dev uses Llama 3 on Groq (and/or Code Llama) to **generate Python code** for the on-device application.
    3.  Generated utility (e.g., image sorter, offline text tool) runs **entirely on-device and offline** on Snapdragon X Elite (using ONNX Runtime or similar).
*   **Key Differentiator:** The Groq/Llama 3 dependency is for the *generation phase* in the cloud; the *edge application's core AI is offline*, meeting the track's critical constraint.
*   **Qualcomm Advantage:** Demonstrating rapid development of practical, offline-first AI utilities tailored for Snapdragon X Elite's capabilities.

**Slide 9: The Integrated Vision - Synergy in Action (Optional)**
*   **Visual:** A diagram showing how Sentient Core (on Vultr) acts as a central hub.
    *   Arrow to E-Commerce Agent Pack (Prosus), showing agents using Fetch.ai, Coral, Groq.
    *   Arrow to Edge AI Utility Generator (Qualcomm), showing code generation and deployment to an edge device.
*   **Narrative:** Emphasize how a single, powerful platform can address diverse AI challenges across the cloud-to-edge spectrum.

**Slide 10: Why Snoob-Dev? Our Unique Strengths**
*   **Unified & Versatile Platform:** From enterprise workflows (Vultr) to specialized e-commerce (Prosus) and innovative edge solutions (Qualcomm).

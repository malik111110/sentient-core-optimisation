## 8. Sentient Core's Strategic Focus for 'Raise Your Hack'

While multiple tracks are available, Sentient Core will primarily focus on delivering solutions that demonstrate its unique capabilities by addressing:

*   **The Vultr Challenge:** By building and deploying a sophisticated, enterprise-grade agentic workflow solution.
*   **The Qualcomm Challenge:** By showcasing Sentient Core's ability to generate on-device AI utilities for the Snapdragon X Elite platform.
*   **A Prosus-aligned E-commerce Solution:** While Prosus is a key organizer (via New Native/Lablab.ai) and not a distinct named track like others, Sentient Core will develop an agent-powered e-commerce application, aligning with Prosus's interest in this domain.

**Core Technology Integration:** A fundamental goal for Sentient Core is the deep and synergistic utilization of:
*   **Groq API** (with Llama models from Meta) for advanced reasoning and generation.
*   **Fetch.ai uAgents** for distributed agent capabilities.
*   **Coral Protocol** for aspects of decentralized AI interaction or data integrity, where applicable.

These technologies will be foundational to the solutions developed for the Vultr, Qualcomm, and Prosus-aligned objectives.

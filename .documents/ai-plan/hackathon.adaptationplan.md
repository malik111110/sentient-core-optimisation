# Hackathon Adaptation Plan

## Notes
- Hackathon "Raise Your Hack" requires fulfilling 3 of 4 sponsor tracks; we will target **Vultr (enterprise agentic workflow)**, **Prosus (agent-powered e-commerce)**, and **Qualcomm (edge AI utility)**.
- Maintain current multi-agent codebase (`sentient-core`) while adding track-specific modules; reuse existing integrations (WebContainer, Archon, Supabase, etc.).
- Must deploy the main web app on Vultr, build an e-commerce agent pack with knowledge-graph profiles, and generate on-device AI utilities for Snapdragon X Elite.
- Utilize tools outlined in the `strategy-adaptation` workflow for research (hyperbrowserai/mcp, tavily, serper, etc.).
- Must integrate Groq API with Llama 3 and adopt Fetch.ai uAgents/Agentverse plus Coral Protocol for inter-agent collaboration.
- Qualcomm offline-first requirement resolved via on-device core utility; Groq/Llama 3 used only for development or optional cloud companion features.
- All new artifacts (strategy, roadmap, pitch) should be versioned via mem0-memory-mcp.
- `HACKATHON_STRATEGY.md` drafted in `.documents/hackathon/`.
- `PITCH_DECK_OUTLINE.md` drafted in `.documents/hackathon/`.
- Planning documents (high-level, technical specification, PRD, task breakdown) updated with hackathon sections.
- `ROADMAP.md` created and drafted with hackathon sprint timeline.
- Project renamed to **Sentient Core**; all documents should reflect new branding.
- Ensure planning documents remain future-proof and not overly tied to specific tech choices.
- Rebranding underway: key core documents (strategy, roadmap, high-level plan, tech spec, pitch deck) already renamed to Sentient Core; remaining docs still to be updated.
- `VISION_AND_MISSION.md`, `BRANDING_GUIDELINES.md`, and `USER_PERSONAS.md` have been drafted and saved.
- Document audit completed; summary report prepared; rebranding edits applied to several legacy documents.
- Landing page scaffolding (Header, Hero, Features, Hackathon, Footer) implemented in Next.js frontend; layout metadata rebranded to Sentient Core.
- Fade-in animations added to landing page sections; landing page polished.
- INFOGRAPHICS.md created outlining infographic slide concepts.
- GroqService client implemented in `src/clients/groq_client.py`.
- FetchAIAdapter implemented in `src/clients/fetchai_adapter.py`.
- CoralMessageHandler scaffolded in `src/clients/coral_message_handler.py`; `requirements.txt` created with dependencies.
- Unit tests for backend clients added in `tests/clients`; `pytest` and `pytest-mock` appended to `requirements.txt`.
- Dependencies installed; unit test execution deferred until after documentation alignment.
- Git repository consolidated at project root; initial root-level commit completed.
- User requested comprehensive documentation alignment; focus shifted to updating core planning documents before further implementation.
- Project directory rename to `sentient-core` initiated; final rename pending after terminating active dev processes.
- `story-concepts-painpoints.md` created in conceptual docs directory.
- Original conceptual docs located under `.documents/concepts and roadmaps/`; duplicates with hackathon enhancements exist in `.documents/project planning/conceptual/` and need consolidation.
- VISION_AND_MISSION, USER_PERSONAS, and story-concepts-painpoints conceptual docs merged into primary directory; consolidation complete.
- User requested proactive real-time data validation (model versions, dependencies) and comprehensive crawl of Raise Your Hack competition page & related tech docs; planning docs must be revised accordingly.
- `RAISE_YOUR_HACK_OVERVIEW.md` created in `.documents/hackathon/` with consolidated event information.
- `GROQ_API_GUIDE.md` created in `.documents/hackathon/groq/` with detailed developer guide for Groq API.
- `FETCHAI_UAGENT_GUIDE.md` created in `.documents/hackathon/fetchai/` with detailed developer guide for Fetch.ai uAgents.
- `CORAL_PROTOCOL_GUIDE.md` created in `.documents/hackathon/coral/` with overview developer guide for Coral Protocol.
- `LLAMA3_MODEL_GUIDE.md` created in `.documents/hackathon/llama3/` with model overview guide for Meta Llama 3.
- `ONNX_RUNTIME_GUIDE.md` created in `.documents/hackathon/tech_refs/onnx_runtime/` with on-device inference guide for ONNX Runtime.
- `NEXTJS_15_GUIDE.md` created in `.documents/hackathon/tech_refs/nextjs/` with developer guide for Next.js 15.
- `FASTAPI_GUIDE.md` created in `.documents/hackathon/tech_refs/fastapi/` with developer guide for FastAPI.

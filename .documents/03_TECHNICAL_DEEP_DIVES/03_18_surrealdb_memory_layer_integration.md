## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the successful integration of a SurrealDB-backed memory layer into the Sentient Core agentic system. The primary objective was to provide agents with a persistent, graph-based memory, enabling them to store, retrieve, and connect information gathered during their operations. This enhancement transforms the system from a stateless task executor into a stateful, learning-capable agentic factory.

The project involved designing a graph schema, implementing a persistence layer, refactoring the `DataAgent` to act as a memory interface, and enhancing the orchestration engine to handle memory-related tasks with dependencies.

## 2. Core Components & Design

The implementation is composed of several key components that work in concert:

### 2.1. Data Models (`memory_models.py`)

New Pydantic models were created to represent the core elements of the knowledge graph:
- **`MemoryNode`**: Represents a single piece of information (e.g., a concept, a file, a user request). It includes a `NodeType` enum to classify the data.
- **`MemoryEdge`**: Represents a directed, typed relationship between two `MemoryNode` objects (e.g., `RELATES_TO`, `DEPENDS_ON`).

### 2.2. Persistence Layer (`surrealdb_persistence.py`)

A dedicated asynchronous persistence module was created to handle all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for nodes and edges in SurrealDB. This layer abstracts the database interactions, providing simple, high-level functions like `create_node` and `create_edge`.

### 2.3. The `DataAgent` as Memory Interface

The `DataAgent` was refactored to be the sole entry point for all memory operations. It interprets natural language tasks (e.g., "create a memory node") and uses the persistence layer to execute them. This centralizes memory management and provides a clear separation of concerns.

## 3. Orchestration & Dependency Management

A major enhancement was the introduction of a task dependency system to allow for more complex, multi-step workflows.

### 3.1. Enhanced `Task` Model (`shared_state.py`)

The core `Task` model was updated to include:
- `task_id`: A unique UUID for each task.
- `depends_on`: A list of `task_id`s that the current task depends on.
- `input_data`: A dictionary to pass data between tasks.

### 3.2. Memory-Aware Planner (`c_suite_planner.py`)

The `CSuitePlanner` was upgraded to be "memory-aware." When it generates a plan containing a data-producing task (e.g., a `ResearchAgent` task), it automatically injects a subsequent `DataAgent` task. This new task is configured to `depend_on` the original task, ensuring the research findings are persisted.

### 3.3. Dependency-Aware Executor (`departmental_executors.py`)

The `DepartmentalExecutor` was refactored to understand and resolve these dependencies. Before executing a task, it checks the `depends_on` field. If dependencies are found, it retrieves the artifacts from the completed parent tasks and injects them into the `input_data` of the current task. This allows the `DataAgent` to receive the output from the `ResearchAgent` and store it in the knowledge graph.

## 4. Validation

The entire workflow was validated through a comprehensive suite of unit and integration tests. The final test, `test_orchestrator_memory_workflow.py`, confirmed the end-to-end success of the system: from planning and dependency injection to execution and final persistence in the mocked SurrealDB layer.

## 5. Conclusion

The integration of the SurrealDB memory layer is a foundational step towards creating a truly intelligent and adaptive agentic system. The agents can now learn from their work, build a persistent knowledge base, and execute more complex, stateful plans. This architecture is now ready to be leveraged for more advanced capabilities.

## 3. Core Principles

*   **Human-Centric:** The user's vision is the ultimate source of truth. The platform exists to augment and amplify human creativity, not replace it.
*   **Trust and Transparency:** Provide clear insights into the agentic processes, allowing for user oversight, intervention, and understanding of the generated output.
*   **Quality by Design:** Build applications that are not just functional but also robust, secure, and maintainable from the ground up.
*   **Unconstrained Innovation:** Remain adaptable and forward-looking, continuously integrating the best technologies and methodologies to solve problems, unbound by any single tech stack.

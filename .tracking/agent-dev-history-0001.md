### 🚀 Development Server
The Next.js development server is now running and accessible at http://localhost:3000

### 📋 Next Steps for Backend Agent
The frontend foundation is complete and ready for backend integration. The backend agent should now:

1. Set up FastAPI backend with matching API endpoints
2. Implement WebSocket server for real-time communication
3. Create database models matching the frontend TypeScript interfaces
4. Set up authentication and authorization systems
5. Implement the multi-agent orchestration system
The frontend is fully prepared to consume backend APIs and display real-time data from the Genesis Engine's AI agents.

# Departmental Executor Agents using LangGraph

# This module will contain the LangGraph workflows for each department
# (e.g., Research, Development). Each workflow will be a state machine
# that executes the tasks assigned by the C-Suite Planner.

        # For now, we'll just simulate completion.

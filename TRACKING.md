# Project Tracking Log

This log tracks significant changes, decisions, and progress for the Genesis Agentic Development Engine project.

## 2025-06-17

- Initialized TRACKING.md.
- Began comprehensive review and validation of planning documents and technical guides.

- Updated `l:\python agents\snoob-dev\.documents\project planning\applied techs\README.md` to accurately list all current technical guides and provide brief descriptions. The previous version was outdated.
- Conducted a high-level review comparing project planning documents (`high-level-plan.md`, `prd.md`, `technical-specification.md`, `task-breakdown.md`) with the set of technical guides in the `applied techs` directory.
- Initial finding: The existing technical guides cover the major technological and architectural areas outlined in the planning documents. No immediate need for creating new technical guide documents was identified, as the current set is comprehensive in scope. The primary documents appear relevant for effective platform building at a foundational documentation level. Further work could involve embedding more project-specific examples from the `technical-specification.md` into these guides.
